Here is a live link to my page : https://anthonygamon.github.io/Password-Generator/

With this assignment I was given the task to make a password generator that allowed the user to make a random passoword that they were able to create using different options depending on which they selected and didn't select. 

First they were given the option to select how long or short their password would be. They needed to decide how long thier password would be, they were given the option of any number more than 8 but less than 128. Then they were asked if they wanted lowercase characters, uppercase characters, numeric characters, or special characters. They are able to make any mix of options as long as they picked at least one. 

If they didn't meet the required criteria an aleart popped up and asked them to either have more than 8 characters, less than 128 characters or select atleast 1 character option.
